title: "Write Like a Human"
description: "No em dashes. No corporate jargon. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it."

AI has tells. Patterns it falls into. Words it loves. Rhythms that sound robotic.

If you want human writing, you have to actively fight these patterns.

## The Banned Words

Words that scream "AI wrote this":

- **Delve**. Humans don't delve. They dig into, explore, examine. Never delve.
- **Leverage**. Use. That's the word. Just use.
- **Landscape**. "The AI landscape is evolving". no. The space, the field, the industry. Not landscape.
- **Robust**. Strong, solid, reliable. Pick one.
- **Utilize**. Use. Always just use.
- **Facilitate**. Help, enable, make easier. Not facilitate.
- **Ecosystem**. Sometimes okay for actual ecosystems (npm ecosystem). Usually overused.
- **Paradigm**. Almost never needed.
- **Synergy**. Never needed.

When you catch these words, replace them. Every time.

## The Em Dash Problem

AI loves em dashes. those long dashes that separate thoughts. because they're technically correct.

Humans use them sparingly. AI uses them constantly.

**Rule:** No em dashes. Use periods. Use commas. Use parentheses if you must. But no em dashes.

## Contractions Are Mandatory

Humans use contractions. It's how we talk.

- Don't → not "do not"
- Can't → not "cannot"  
- It's → not "it is"
- We're → not "we are"

If you're writing "do not" and "cannot," you sound like a legal document.

Write like you talk.

## Vary Your Rhythm

AI falls into patterns:
- Same sentence length
- Same structure repeated
- Predictable flow

Humans vary it up. Short sentences. Then longer ones that build on the idea and add detail. Then short again.

See? That's rhythm.

## Start Sentences How Humans Do

Humans start sentences with "And" or "But" sometimes. Because it flows.

AI hesitates to do this. It's "grammatically incorrect" (it's not, but AI was trained on formal writing).

Break the rules when they sound better broken.

## The Press Release Test

Read your writing out loud. Does it sound like:

**A press release?**
"We are pleased to announce that our innovative solution leverages cutting-edge AI to facilitate robust outcomes in the evolving landscape..."

**Or a human?**
"We built a tool that uses AI to make X easier. Here's how it works."

If it sounds like the first one, rewrite it.

## Active Voice, Not Passive

**Passive:** "The decision was made to implement the feature."

**Active:** "We decided to implement the feature."

Passive voice is how committees write. Active voice is how humans write.

## Remove Hedging

AI hedges constantly:
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's important to mention..."
- "One might consider..."

Just say the thing:
- "Note that..." (or just say it without the preamble)
- "Also,..."
- "Consider..."

Confident statements beat hedged ones.

## The Rewrite Process

1. Let AI generate the first draft
2. Read it out loud
3. Catch the tells (em dashes, banned words, robotic rhythm)
4. Rewrite in your voice
5. Read it again
6. Ship when it sounds human

Writing like a human takes effort when AI is involved. It's worth it.

Your voice is your brand. Don't let the AI make you sound generic.
