title: Agent-Friendly Content
description: Write for humans and AI. Same content, two entry points. Structure it once, reach both.
---

Content should be readable by both humans and AI. Complete metadata (titles, descriptions, dates, tags), structured data (JSON-LD), and full-text indexes (llms.txt) let AI cite, reference, and recommend your work accurately.

This isn't extra work. It's structuring the work you're already doing. Proper headings help humans navigate and AI parse. Good metadata helps search engines and AI assistants find you. You write once. Humans read it. AI references it.

If your content is only human-readable, AI has to guess. If it's agent-friendly, AI becomes a distribution channel for your work.
