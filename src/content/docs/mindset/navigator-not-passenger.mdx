# Be a Navigator, Not a Passenger

AI is a tool, not a replacement for judgment. Your job isn't to passively accept AI outputs. It's to **actively steer** the collaboration toward better results.

Think of AI as a car with advanced autopilot. You're still responsible for the destination, the route, and overriding when the system makes a mistake.

## What Navigating Looks Like

**Passive (passenger mindset):**
- Ask AI a question
- Accept the first answer
- Move on

**Active (navigator mindset):**
- Ask AI a question
- Evaluate the answer: Does this address the core issue? What's missing?
- Follow up: "What about edge case X?" or "How does this change if constraint Y applies?"
- Refine iteratively until the output is actually useful

## Real Examples

### Code Generation

**Passenger:** "Write a function to validate email addresses." → Copy the output → Hope it works.

**Navigator:** "Write a function to validate email addresses." → Review the regex → Ask: "Does this handle plus-addressing (user+tag@domain.com)?" → Refine → Ask: "What edge cases might this miss?" → Add test cases → Ship.

### Content Writing

**Passenger:** "Write a blog post about AI workflows." → Accept the draft → Publish.

**Navigator:** "Draft an outline for a blog post about AI workflows, targeting developers who are new to AI." → Review the structure → "The introduction is too generic. Rewrite it to hook developers with a specific pain point." → "This section on prompt engineering is too abstract. Add a concrete before/after example." → Iterate → Publish.

### Decision-Making

**Passenger:** "Should we adopt this new framework?" → Accept AI's recommendation → Implement.

**Navigator:** "What are the trade-offs of adopting framework X versus sticking with our current setup?" → Review the analysis → "You mentioned vendor lock-in as a risk. How significant is that for a team of our size?" → "What's the migration cost in developer-hours?" → Weigh AI's input against team constraints → Decide.

## The Steering Wheel Metaphors

**Direction:** AI might suggest a path, but you choose the destination. If AI drafts a solution that's technically correct but doesn't align with your goals, redirect it.

**Speed:** AI generates fast. Sometimes too fast. Slowing down to think critically about outputs is more valuable than maximizing throughput.

**Detours:** If AI's first approach doesn't work, don't give up. Try a different prompt, provide more context, or break the problem into smaller pieces.

**Overrides:** When AI generates something unsafe, incorrect, or misaligned with your values, override it immediately. Don't defer to the machine.

## Why This Matters

AI tools are getting better at sounding confident even when wrong. Claude, GPT, and other models will happily generate plausible-but-incorrect code, persuasive-but-misleading arguments, or confident-but-unfounded recommendations.

**Your judgment is the quality filter.** If you abdicate that responsibility, you get whatever the model happens to generate. which might be brilliant, mediocre, or dangerously wrong.

## Building the Skill

1. **Always ask follow-up questions.** Treat the first response as a draft, not the final answer.
2. **Challenge assumptions.** If AI says "This is the best approach," ask: "Best for what criteria? What are the alternatives?"
3. **Request alternatives.** Don't settle for the first solution. Ask: "What are 3 other ways to solve this?"
4. **Verify claims.** If AI cites a fact or technique you're unfamiliar with, look it up. Models hallucinate.
5. **Edit ruthlessly.** AI-generated text often has filler. Cut what doesn't serve your purpose.

## The Balance

Being a navigator doesn't mean micromanaging every word AI generates. Sometimes the first output is good enough. Sometimes you can trust AI to handle details while you focus on strategy.

**The key:** You're making a conscious choice about when to intervene and when to accept. You're not defaulting to acceptance out of laziness or assuming AI always knows best.

## The Outcome

When you navigate well, AI becomes a genuine force multiplier. It handles the grunt work, explores options you wouldn't have thought of, and surfaces insights faster than you could alone.

But the **direction, judgment, and final call** remain yours.
