title: Opus for Thinking, Sonnet for Doing
description: Match model capability to task complexity. Save premium models for hard problems.
---


**The principle:** Use expensive, powerful models (Opus) for complex reasoning. Use balanced models (Sonnet) for execution. Use cheap models (Haiku) for routine work.

Match the model to the task. Don't waste Opus on simple jobs. Don't handicap yourself by using Haiku for hard problems.

## The Model Tiers

### Claude Opus (Premium)

**Best for:**
- Novel problem-solving
- Strategic planning
- Complex code architecture
- Unfamiliar domains
- High-stakes decisions
- "Figure this out" tasks

**Cost:** ~5x Sonnet (~50x Haiku)

**When to use:** When the task requires deep thinking, when stakes are high, or when you need the smartest available model.

### Claude Sonnet (Balanced)

**Best for:**
- Most coding tasks
- Content writing
- Routine problem-solving
- Implementing known patterns
- Refactoring
- "Build this" tasks

**Cost:** ~3x Haiku

**When to use:** Default choice for most work. Smart enough for 80% of tasks, cheap enough to use frequently.

### Claude Haiku (Economy)

**Best for:**
- Simple edits
- Classification/filtering
- Template filling
- Repetitive tasks
- Background checks
- "Do this obvious thing" tasks

**Cost:** Baseline

**When to use:** High-volume routine work. Tasks where "good enough" is actually good enough.

## Decision Framework

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Is this a new problem or a known pattern?**
   - New → Opus or Sonnet
   - Known → Sonnet or Haiku

2. **What's the cost of a mistake?**
   - High (production code, customer-facing) → Opus or Sonnet
   - Low (internal docs, drafts) → Sonnet or Haiku

3. **Does this require creativity or just execution?**
   - Creativity → Opus
   - Execution → Sonnet
   - Rote work → Haiku

4. **How many times will I run this?**
   - Once → Use what's needed, cost doesn't matter
   - 100 times → Optimize for cheapest model that works

## Real Examples from Our Practice

### Task: Write a Blog Post

**Opus approach:**
- Draft outline (strategic thinking about structure)
- Generate first draft (Sonnet handles this fine)
- Review and refine (Sonnet)

**Cost:** 1 Opus call + 2 Sonnet calls

**Sonnet-only approach:**
- Draft outline (Sonnet)
- Generate first draft (Sonnet)
- Review and refine (Sonnet)

**Cost:** 3 Sonnet calls ≈ 0.6 Opus calls

**The call:** Sonnet is fine for blog posts. Save Opus for harder problems.

### Task: Design a New System Architecture

**Sonnet approach:**
- Risk: Might miss edge cases, suggest suboptimal patterns

**Opus approach:**
- Explores alternatives thoroughly
- Considers tradeoffs deeply
- Flags potential issues

**The call:** Use Opus. The 5x cost is worth it when designing something new.

### Task: Batch-Process 500 Files

**Sonnet approach:**
- Cost: 500 Sonnet calls = 100 Opus calls equivalent
- Might overspend on routine work

**Haiku approach:**
- Cost: 500 Haiku calls = 10 Opus calls equivalent
- Good enough for simple transformations

**The call:** Use Haiku. You're doing the same simple task 500 times.

## The Escalation Pattern

Start cheap, escalate if needed:

1. **Try Haiku** → If it works, you saved money
2. **If Haiku fails** → Try Sonnet
3. **If Sonnet struggles** → Use Opus

**Example:**
- Task: Summarize a technical paper
- Haiku attempt: Misses key nuance
- Sonnet attempt: Good summary
- Stop here, don't escalate to Opus

**Cost:** 1 Haiku + 1 Sonnet ≈ 0.5 Opus

**Benefit:** You tried the cheap option first. Only spent more when needed.

## The "Thinking Budget"

We reserve a portion of our weekly quota for Opus:

- **70% Sonnet/Haiku:** Execution, routine work
- **30% Opus:** Strategic thinking, complex problems

**Why:** Ensures we don't blow the entire budget on routine tasks, leaving nothing for hard problems.

**Tracking:** Weekly usage reports show model distribution. If Opus usage drops to 5%, we're probably not tackling hard enough problems. If it climbs to 60%, we're overspending.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Using Opus for everything**
- "It's the best model, so I should always use it"
- Result: Quota exhausted in 2 days, no work possible rest of week

❌ **Using Haiku for everything**
- "I want to save money"
- Result: Poor quality, wasted time fixing bad outputs

❌ **Never escalating**
- "Sonnet should be able to do this"
- Result: Struggling with a task that Opus would solve in one shot

✅ **Right approach:**
- Default to Sonnet
- Use Haiku for high-volume simple tasks
- Escalate to Opus when the task genuinely requires it
- Track usage to maintain balance

## The Mental Shift

Traditional software: "CPU time is expensive, optimize everything."  
AI workflows: "Thinking is expensive, execution is cheap."

**Optimize for:**
- Using the right tool for the job
- Spending premium tokens on hard problems
- Batching routine work to use cheaper models

**Don't optimize for:**
- Always using the "best" model
- Saving money on tasks where quality matters
- Avoiding Opus when you're genuinely stuck

## The Productivity Paradox

**Paradox:** Sometimes using the expensive model is more economical.

**Example:**
- Spend 10 Sonnet calls struggling with a problem → 2 Opus equivalents
- Or spend 1 Opus call solving it immediately → 1 Opus equivalent

**The expensive model was cheaper** because it solved the problem faster.

**Lesson:** Don't be penny-wise, pound-foolish. Use Opus when it saves overall time and tokens.
