title: Quality Is Iterations
description: The ceiling for quality is now perfection. The only limits are compute and diminishing returns.

Before AI, iterations were expensive. Every review cycle cost human time, attention, energy. So we shipped "good enough" because perfect wasn't worth the effort.

That constraint is gone. With AI and agents, you can run dozens of iterations on a piece of work before a human even looks at it. Draft, review, refine, review again. Each pass catches something the previous one missed. The ceiling is now perfection, limited only by the compute you're willing to spend and the law of diminishing returns.

The practical question isn't "is this good enough?" anymore. It's "how many iterations is this worth?" A throwaway internal doc? One pass. A public article? Three. A critical system? As many as it takes.
