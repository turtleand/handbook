# Seek a Plurality of Voices

A single perspective is a single blind spot. This applies to humans and AI equally.

When you ask one model one question, you get one framing. That framing might be brilliant. It might also be narrow, biased toward the training data, or anchored to the most common answer rather than the most useful one.

The fix is simple: [seek a plurality of voices](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/plurality-of-voices-ai/). Ask multiple models. Ask the same model to argue different sides. Ask a domain expert. Ask someone outside the domain entirely. Each perspective reveals something the others miss.

This isn't about consensus. It's about surface area. The more angles you see, the better your own judgment becomes. And better judgment is the one thing AI can't replace.
