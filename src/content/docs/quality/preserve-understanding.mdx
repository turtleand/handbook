Delegating execution to AI is fine. Giving up on understanding what it does is a different thing entirely.

When you understand the reasoning behind AI's output, you can shape it, correct it, push back when you disagree. You can spot when the model is confidently wrong. You can explain the decision to someone else. You retain options.

When you don't understand, you can only accept or reject. That's a binary where you used to have a spectrum.

This doesn't mean everyone needs to trace every step. Understanding is not mandatory. But it's valuable precisely because it keeps your options open. The person who understands why the AI recommended a particular architecture can adapt it when requirements change. The person who just accepted the recommendation starts over.

Organizations that preserve understanding across their teams stay flexible. Those that treat AI output as a black box become dependent on it in ways that are hard to reverse.

Understanding is optionality. Protect it where it matters.
