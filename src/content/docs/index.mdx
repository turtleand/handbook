# The AI Handbook

This handbook captures principles we've learned running an AI-first development practice. It's not theory — it's what works in production, tested through thousands of AI-assisted commits, articles, and automations.

## What This Is

A quick-reference guide organized by theme. Each principle is a standalone page you can link to or reference. Think of it as design patterns for AI collaboration.

## Who This Is For

Builders who want to work faster and smarter with AI. Whether you're managing AI agents, writing with AI assistance, or just trying to get more done, these principles compound over time.

## How to Use This

- **Browse by category** — Mindset, Workflow, Economics, Quality, Organizational Knowledge, Human Element
- **Read what resonates** — you don't need to read sequentially
- **Apply immediately** — each principle is actionable
- **Cross-reference** — principles connect; follow the links

## Philosophy

We believe AI is a tool that gets better every day. The workflows you build now will only improve as models advance. The cost of learning is front-loaded; the benefits compound forever.

Start with [Ethan Mollick's Four Principles](/foundations/ethan-mollick-principles) — the foundation everything else builds on.
