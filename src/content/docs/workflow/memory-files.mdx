# Memory Files Over Mental Notes

AI agents wake up fresh every session. They don't remember yesterday unless you write it down.

**The rule:** If you want to remember something, write it to a file. "Mental notes" don't survive restarts.

## Why Memory Files Matter

**The problem:** You have a great conversation with your AI agent. You make decisions, learn things, establish preferences. Then the session ends. Tomorrow, you start fresh. The agent has forgotten everything.

**The solution:** Persistent context files that carry knowledge across sessions.

## The Memory System We Use

### Daily Notes (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

Raw logs of what happened each day:
- Decisions made
- Problems solved
- Things to follow up on
- Temporary context

**Purpose:** Capture everything. Don't filter. Like a daily journal.

**Example entry:**
```markdown
## 2024-02-22

- Decided to use Starlight for handbook site (cleaner than Nextra)
- Figured out voice transcription issue: Deepgram whisper-large works, Nova-2 fails
- TODO: Set up Netlify deploy for handbook repo
- Turtleand prefers blog posts published Tuesday mornings (ART timezone)
```

### Long-Term Memory (`MEMORY.md`)

Curated insights extracted from daily notes:
- Preferences and style
- Lessons learned
- Important decisions
- Persistent context

**Purpose:** The distilled essence. What's worth keeping long-term.

**Example entry:**
```markdown
## Publishing Preferences

- Blog posts publish Tuesday mornings (ART timezone)
- Dev.to drafts need manual cover image upload (CDN caching issues)
- Always use TurtleandBot identity for git commits
```

### Specialized Files

- `SOUL.md`. Who the agent is (personality, values, behavior)
- `USER.md`. Who the human is (preferences, context, background)
- `TOOLS.md`. Local setup notes (camera names, SSH hosts, API keys)
- `HEARTBEAT.md`. What to check during periodic heartbeats

**Purpose:** Topic-specific persistent context.

## The Workflow

### Capture

When something important happens:
1. **Immediately write it down** (to today's daily file)
2. Don't trust memory. yours or the AI's
3. Err on the side of over-documenting

### Curate

Periodically (weekly or during heartbeats):
1. Review recent daily files
2. Extract what's worth keeping long-term
3. Update `MEMORY.md` or other persistent files
4. Archive or summarize old daily notes

### Retrieve

When starting a new session:
1. AI reads `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`
2. AI reads today's and yesterday's daily files
3. AI has full context from day one

**No ramp-up time.** The agent knows your preferences, past decisions, and current priorities.

## What to Document

**Always document:**
- Decisions (especially "why" not just "what")
- Preferences (tools, styles, workflows)
- Lessons learned (mistakes, discoveries)
- Context that will matter later (project status, dependencies)

**Usually document:**
- Interesting findings from research
- Useful prompts or commands
- People, places, things to remember
- Things you said "I should remember this"

**Don't bother documenting:**
- Obvious facts (the sky is blue)
- Information that's easy to look up (today's date)
- Temporary noise (routine status updates)

**The test:** Will this matter in a week? In a month? If yes, document it.

## The Compound Effect

**Week 1:** You have a few notes. Helpful but minimal.  
**Month 1:** You have context on preferences, common patterns, frequent tasks.  
**Month 3:** Your AI agent knows you well. Suggestions are tailored. Fewer clarifying questions.  
**Month 6:** The agent anticipates needs. Remembers past decisions. Feels like a long-term colleague.

**The value compounds.** Every documented preference makes future interactions smoother.

## Real Example

**Without memory files:**
- You: "Draft a blog post."
- AI: "What topic? What tone? What length? Who's the audience?"
- You: (answering all the same questions you answered last week)

**With memory files:**
- You: "Draft a blog post about [topic]."
- AI: "On it. Targeting developers, conversational tone, 800-1200 words, Tuesday publish. Draft ready for review."
- You: (one message, done)

**The difference:** Context persistence. The AI remembers what you told it before.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Relying on conversation history:** Conversations get long. Important details get buried. Start fresh with files.

❌ **Forgetting to document:** You think "I'll remember this." You won't. Write it down now.

❌ **Over-organizing:** Don't create 50 files with elaborate taxonomies. Start simple. A daily file and a long-term file are enough.

❌ **Never curating:** Daily files pile up. Extract the good stuff into long-term memory periodically.

## The Meta Lesson

This principle applies beyond AI agents:

- Personal notes → Capture learnings, don't rely on memory
- Team wikis → Document decisions so future teammates understand "why"
- Code comments → Explain intent so future-you knows what past-you was thinking

**Write it down.** Files persist. Memory fades.
