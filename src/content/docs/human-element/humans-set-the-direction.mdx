title: Humans Set the Direction
description: People determine the goals, the reasons, and the path. Agents help execute the mission.

The most important parts of any organization are the humans. They coordinate with each other, share what they know, learn from each other, and together they determine where to go and why.

Direction isn't something you delegate. It comes from people debating, aligning, disagreeing, and eventually choosing a path together. The goals, the reasons behind the goals, the priorities, the trade-offs. All of that is human work.

Individually and collectively, they then direct agents to help execute that mission. Agents draft, scan, iterate, and scale the work. But the mission itself, the "why are we doing this" and "what matters most," that stays with the people.

Agents are force multipliers. They don't set the course. They help you get there faster.
