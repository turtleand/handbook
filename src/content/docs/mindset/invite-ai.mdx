title: Always Invite AI to the Table

Don't pre-filter tasks for AI. Don't decide in advance what's "too creative" or "too complex." Invite AI to participate in everything, then choose what to use.

This principle was articulated by [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) in *Co-Intelligence* as one of four foundational rules for working with AI.

Most people ask: "Is this task suitable for AI?" AI-first practitioners ask: "How can AI contribute to this task?" The first question leads to binary thinking. The second opens collaboration.

The cost of inviting AI is near zero. The potential upside is unbounded. And the most valuable contributions often come from tasks you didn't think AI could handle.
