Your AI infrastructure should survive any single provider going away.

## The principle

Models are interchangeable. Your prompts, context, workflows, and memory system are the real assets. Build so the model is the easiest part to replace.

## In practice

- **Treat models as pluggable components.** Config changes, not code rewrites.
- **Write model-agnostic prompts.** Clear instructions work everywhere. Exploiting one model's quirks creates a dependency.
- **Keep a migration checklist ready.** Not if, when. Know where every provider-specific reference lives.
- **Test failover before you need it.** Add a second provider. Verify it works. You don't have to use it daily.
- **Separate context from model.** Memory files, personality docs, tool configs: all portable. If they're stored in provider-agnostic formats, migration is just pointing a new model at the same context.

## The test

Could you switch your primary model in under 4 hours? If not, you have hidden dependencies. Find them before the email arrives telling you the clock is ticking.
