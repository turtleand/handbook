AI capabilities change [faster than your assumptions about them](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/check-again/). The task you dismissed as "AI can't do that" three months ago? Try it again. The workflow you built around a limitation? That limitation might be gone.

The most valuable information is what just happened, because it hasn't been priced in yet. Old information isn't worthless. It's just not urgent. Don't let it compete with what's changing right now.

## Today's Models Are the Worst They'll Ever Be

Every model you use today is the worst version you'll ever experience. This means: don't wait for AI to "get good enough." It's already good enough. And it only gets better.

If you build a workflow around today's capabilities, that workflow improves automatically as models advance. The investment is front-loaded. The returns compound forever.

This principle was articulated by [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) in *Co-Intelligence*. It remains one of the most practical frames for AI adoption: start now, because waiting has a compounding cost too.
