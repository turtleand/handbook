title: Reduce the Human Bottleneck
description: Optimize every workflow so humans spend less time on friction and more on judgment.
---

In any human-AI workflow, [the human is the bottleneck](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/human-bottleneck-ai/). AI processes in seconds what takes us minutes. So every workflow should be optimized to reduce friction for the human side. Input, output, format, timing. All of it.

Voice is one example. Speaking is faster than typing. Listening is faster than reading when you're multitasking. A 30-second voice note captures nuance that a typed message loses. But voice is just one lever.

The broader principle: meet humans where they are. If someone works on mobile, don't require a desktop interface. If the output is a decision, don't deliver a 2000-word report. If the input is messy context, accept messy context and let AI structure it.

Every point of friction between the human and the AI is wasted capacity. Remove it.
