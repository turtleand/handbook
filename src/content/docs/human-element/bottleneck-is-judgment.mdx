title: "The Bottleneck Is Judgment, Not Speed"
description: "AI is fast. Knowing WHAT to build is the hard part."

AI can write code faster than you can type. It can generate content in seconds. It can analyze data, create designs, draft documentation.

Speed isn't the constraint. Judgment is.

## What AI Is Good At

Execution. Taking a clear specification and implementing it quickly.

Give AI a well-defined task and it'll crush it:
- "Write a React component with these props"
- "Generate test cases for this function"
- "Refactor this code to use async/await"

These are fast. These are reliable. These are automatable.

## What AI Can't Do

Decide what's worth building.

AI doesn't know:
- Which features matter to users
- What's strategically important
- Where to focus limited time
- What to build next
- When to ship vs. polish
- What makes this product special

That's judgment. That's taste. That's the human advantage.

## The Real Skill

Knowing what to ask for.

A mediocre engineer with great judgment beats a great engineer with mediocre judgment. Because the mediocre engineer builds the right things, even if slowly.

Add AI to the mix: great judgment + AI execution is unstoppable. Bad judgment + AI execution just builds the wrong things faster.

## Where Humans Add Value

**Priorities:** What should we work on first?

**Trade-offs:** Speed vs. quality? Features vs. stability?

**Strategy:** What's the long-term vision?

**Taste:** Does this feel right?

**Context:** What do our users actually need?

AI can execute on any of these. But it can't decide which answer is right. That's on you.

## The Workflow

1. Human decides what to build (judgment)
2. AI executes the plan (speed)
3. Human reviews the result (judgment again)
4. AI iterates based on feedback (speed again)

The loop is fast because AI handles execution. The output is good because humans handle judgment.

## Don't Automate Direction

You can automate code generation, content drafting, data analysis, deployment pipelines.

You can't automate figuring out what your product should be. What your users need. What makes you different.

That's the irreplaceable part. That's where you add unique value.

AI makes execution nearly free. That makes judgment exponentially more valuable.

The bottleneck used to be "can we build this fast enough?"

Now it's "are we building the right thing?"

Spend your time on that question. Let AI handle the rest.
