# Automated First Pass, Human Final Review

The most productive AI workflow: **AI generates the first draft, human provides the final review.**

This isn't about replacing human creativity. It's about spending human time where it matters most — refining, deciding, and adding the touches only humans can provide.

## Why This Works

**AI is faster at:** Starting from blank. Structuring information. Generating variations. Handling boilerplate.

**Humans are better at:** Judging quality. Adding nuance. Aligning with goals. Making final calls.

**The workflow:** Let AI do what it's fast at. You do what requires judgment.

## Real Applications

### Writing

**Old way:** Stare at blank page → Draft introduction → Revise → Draft body → Revise → Repeat until done.

**AI-augmented:** "Draft a blog post about [topic] targeting [audience]. Include sections on X, Y, Z." → Review the draft → Rewrite weak sections → Refine tone → Add personal anecdotes → Publish.

**Time saved:** 60-70%. Quality improved: Yes, because you spend more time refining and less time generating.

### Code

**Old way:** Write function from scratch → Test → Debug → Refactor → Repeat.

**AI-augmented:** "Write a function that does X, handling edge cases Y and Z." → Review the logic → Add test cases → Refactor for clarity → Ship.

**Time saved:** 40-50% on routine tasks. More on boilerplate, less on novel algorithms.

### Documentation

**Old way:** Procrastinate because documentation is boring → Finally write minimal docs → Ship.

**AI-augmented:** "Document this API endpoint. Include parameters, return values, and example usage." → Review for accuracy → Add context only you know → Ship.

**Time saved:** 70-80%. Bonus: Documentation actually gets written instead of skipped.

## The Human Review Checklist

When reviewing AI-generated work, focus on:

1. **Accuracy:** Are the facts correct? Does the logic hold?
2. **Alignment:** Does this match the goal? Is the tone right?
3. **Completeness:** What's missing? What edge cases weren't addressed?
4. **Originality:** Does this add value, or just restate common knowledge?
5. **Voice:** Does this sound like you/your team, or generic AI?

**Don't waste time on:** Formatting (AI handles that). Boilerplate (AI's strength). Routine structure (AI's fine at this).

## When to Iterate

Sometimes the first AI draft is 90% there. Sometimes it's 50%. Sometimes it's 10%.

**If it's 90%:** Quick edits, ship.  
**If it's 50%:** Identify what's wrong. Give AI specific feedback. Regenerate.  
**If it's 10%:** The prompt was unclear, or the task is genuinely hard for AI. Clarify the ask or do it manually.

**Rule of thumb:** If you're spending more time editing than it would take to write from scratch, rethink the approach.

## The Collaboration Loop

The best results come from iteration:

1. AI drafts
2. Human reviews, notes issues
3. Human refines the prompt or provides corrections
4. AI regenerates
5. Repeat until quality threshold is met

This isn't "AI does 100% of the work." It's "AI and human collaborate, each contributing what they're best at."

## What This Doesn't Mean

**It doesn't mean:** Blindly accepting AI output.  
**It means:** Using AI to accelerate the grunt work so you can focus on the high-value parts.

**It doesn't mean:** AI-generated work is "good enough."  
**It means:** AI gets you to 70-80% faster, and human review brings it to 100%.

**It doesn't mean:** You stop learning the craft.  
**It means:** You stop spending time on repetitive parts so you can focus on mastery.

## The Productivity Gain

When this workflow clicks, you feel it immediately:

- Blog posts that used to take 4 hours now take 90 minutes
- Code that used to take a day now takes half a day
- Documentation that used to get skipped now gets done

**The time saved compounds.** More output. More experiments. More learning cycles.
