If it's not written down, it doesn't exist. AI sessions restart. Context resets. Mental notes vanish. Decisions, lessons, context, preferences. Write them down or lose them.

Capture more than you think you need. Not just big decisions. Small ones too. Not just facts, but reasoning. "We chose X because of Y" tells future-you why, so they don't reverse it without understanding the constraint.

And here's the thing: the research is happening anyway. When you investigate a tool, solve a problem, or make a decision, you're already doing the work. Documenting it publicly costs almost nothing extra and creates a second output. Your immediate answer plus a public artifact others can learn from. Same activity, double value.

Write it down. Publish what's useful. The work is already happening. Capturing it is free compounding.
