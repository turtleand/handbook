# Ethan Mollick's Four Principles

**Ethan Mollick**, Wharton professor and author of *Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI*, articulated four principles that we've found foundational to everything we do with AI. These aren't theoretical — they're the baseline for AI-augmented work.

## The Four Principles

### 1. Always Invite AI to the Table

Bring AI into every task. Don't pre-filter. Don't decide in advance what AI "can't" do. Default to including it, then decide what to keep.

**In practice:** We run AI agents in background loops checking email, monitoring builds, drafting blog posts, reviewing code. Some outputs get used as-is. Some get refined. Some get discarded. But AI always gets a seat at the table.

### 2. Always Be the Human in the Loop

AI generates. Humans decide. Maintain oversight, especially for irreversible actions.

**In practice:** Our AI agents can draft PRs, write articles, and manage schedules — but they can't send external emails, merge to production, or post publicly without approval. The human stays in control.

### 3. Treat AI Like a New Employee

Give context. Check work. Build trust over time. AI doesn't know your standards until you teach them.

**In practice:** We maintain context files (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`) that persist across sessions. The more our agents know about us, the better they perform. Like onboarding a junior developer, we document expectations and correct mistakes early.

### 4. AI's Capabilities Change Constantly

What didn't work last month might work now. What works today might be obsolete next quarter. Stay curious.

**In practice:** We revisit failed experiments quarterly. Voice transcription that was unusable in 2023 is production-ready in 2024. Image generation that required careful prompting now handles complex scenes. The frontier moves fast.

## How Our Ecosystem Extends These

Every principle in this handbook builds on Mollick's foundation:

- **Mindset** principles (like "Today's Models Are the Worst They'll Ever Be") extend principle #4
- **Workflow** principles (like "Sub-Agents for Parallelism") operationalize principle #1
- **Quality** principles (like "Trust But Verify") formalize principle #2
- **Organizational Knowledge** principles (like "Compound Your Context") systematize principle #3

Start here. The rest follows.
