Content should be readable by both humans and AI. That's not two audiences. It's one audience with two entry points.

## The Third Language

You already write for:
- **Humans**. natural language, formatted for reading
- **Machines**. structured data, formatted for parsing

Agent-friendly content is both. It's written for humans but structured for machines.

## What Makes Content Agent-Friendly

**Complete frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: "Exact Title"
description: "Clear one-line summary"
date: 2024-02-15
author: "Turtleand"
tags: ["ai", "automation", "workflow"]
---
```

Humans see metadata. AI gets structured fields it can query.

**llms.txt files:**
Full-text indexes that AI can read directly. No need to spider your site. Just read one file and get everything.

**JSON-LD structured data:**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Title Here",
  "description": "Description here"
}
</script>
```

Search engines use this. AI uses this. Same data, multiple consumers.

**Clear semantic structure:**
Proper heading hierarchy. Meaningful section breaks. Logical flow.

Humans navigate by headings. AI parses by structure. Good structure helps both.

## Why It Matters

If your content is only human-readable, AI has to hallucinate or scrape poorly. It can't reliably reference your work.

If your content is agent-friendly, AI can:
- Cite your articles accurately
- Cross-reference between pieces
- Build on your published knowledge
- Recommend your content when relevant

You get credit. Users get accurate information. AI gets reliable sources.

## The Workflow

Every content PR should include:
1. Complete frontmatter
2. llms.txt regeneration (automated in build)
3. JSON-LD structured data
4. Proper heading hierarchy

This isn't extra work. It's structuring work you're already doing.

## The Multiplier Effect

Agent-friendly content:
- Ranks better in search (structured data helps SEO)
- Gets cited by AI (proper attribution)
- Becomes findable programmatically (llms.txt)
- Compounds your reach (AI recommends it)

You write once. Humans find it. AI references it. Your effort multiplies.

## In Practice

Before publishing:
- Frontmatter complete? ✓
- llms.txt will auto-update? ✓
- JSON-LD present? ✓
- Headings make sense? ✓

If yes to all four, ship it. You've made content that works for everyone.

Write once. Reach humans and AI. That's agent-friendly content.
