# Today's Models Are the Worst They'll Ever Be

Every AI model you use today is the worst version you'll ever experience. Claude 3 Opus was groundbreaking in March 2024. By December it felt slow and limited compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GPT-4 was magic in 2023. Now it's the baseline.

**The principle:** Don't wait for AI to "get good enough" before investing in AI-augmented workflows. It's already good enough. And it only gets better from here.

## Why This Matters

If you build a workflow around today's AI capabilities, that workflow improves automatically as models advance. The prompt you wrote for GPT-4 works better with GPT-4.5. The agent you designed for Claude Sonnet gets smarter when you switch to Opus.

**The investment is front-loaded.** Learning to write effective prompts, structure context files, and design human-AI collaboration patterns takes time. But once you've built the habit, every model upgrade is free performance gain.

## Real Examples

In our practice:

- **Voice transcription:** Unusable in 2023 (too many errors). Production-ready in 2024 (Deepgram Whisper). Now we default to voice input for complex instructions.
- **Code generation:** Required heavy editing in 2023. By 2024, 80% of AI-generated code ships with minor tweaks.
- **Content drafting:** Needed complete rewrites in early 2023. Now AI drafts often ship with light editing for tone.

We didn't wait. We built workflows when AI was "good enough," and every improvement since has been a bonus.

## The Alternative

The alternative is waiting. Waiting for models to improve before you learn the tools. Waiting for "the right time" to adopt AI workflows.

**The cost of waiting compounds negatively.** Every month you delay is a month you're not building muscle memory, not refining prompts, not discovering which tasks AI handles well. Meanwhile, early adopters are compounding their advantage.

## How to Apply This

1. **Start small:** Pick one repetitive task. Draft an email. Summarize a document. Generate test data.
2. **Build the habit:** Use AI even when manual feels faster. The learning curve pays off.
3. **Document what works:** Save effective prompts. Note which tasks AI handles well.
4. **Revisit failures:** Something that didn't work 6 months ago? Try again.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time is now.
