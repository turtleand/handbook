title: Human Strength Is the Intent
description: Your intent persists across every tool change. That's the one thing that doesn't expire.

Your intent persists, but your tools don't. The specific AI tools you use today will be different in six months. The API syntax, the platform quirks, the model-specific tricks. All of it expires.

What compounds is [the habit of pursuing your intent through AI](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/pursuing-your-intent/). Knowing when to reach for AI, how to frame problems for it, how to evaluate its output. Those meta-skills transfer across every model change. They're yours to keep.

Don't over-invest in mastering any single tool. Invest in the intent behind using it.
