# The Last 5 Minutes Matter Most

In AI conversations, **recency dominates**. The last few exchanges carry more weight than everything that came before. This isn't a bug — it's how attention mechanisms work. Use it strategically.

## Why Recency Matters

Large language models use attention to weigh different parts of the conversation. Recent tokens get more attention. Distant tokens fade.

**Practical implication:** If you bury critical context at the start of a long conversation, the AI might overlook it by the time you ask the important question. But if you surface that context right before the question, it's fresh and prominent.

## Structuring Conversations

**Bad pattern:**
1. Provide all context upfront (5000 words)
2. Ask a small question
3. Wonder why AI missed the key detail from paragraph 2

**Better pattern:**
1. Provide enough context to start
2. Ask the question
3. If AI misses something, re-surface it: "Given that [specific detail], how does your answer change?"

**Best pattern:**
1. Build context incrementally
2. Right before asking the critical question, summarize the 3 most important constraints
3. Ask the question

## Real Examples

**Writing assistance:**
Instead of: "Here's a 3000-word draft. Please improve the introduction."  
Try: "I'm revising the introduction to this article. The key points are X, Y, Z. The tone should be conversational but authoritative. Here's the current intro: [text]. How can this be stronger?"

**Code review:**
Instead of: "Here's the entire codebase. Review this function."  
Try: "I'm reviewing this authentication function. It needs to handle edge case X and maintain performance constraint Y. Here's the function: [code]. What issues do you see?"

**Decision-making:**
Instead of: "Here's everything we discussed this week. Should we proceed?"  
Try: "We've explored options A, B, C. The key constraints are [list]. Our preference is B because [reason]. What are we missing?"

## The "Fresh Eyes" Technique

Sometimes you need AI to reconsider something from earlier in the conversation.

**Don't:** Scroll back and hope it remembers.  
**Do:** Re-state the context explicitly: "Earlier you suggested approach X. Given what we've learned since [new info], does that recommendation still hold?"

This is why we maintain separate context files (like `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`) rather than relying on conversation history. Files let us inject critical context right when it's needed, not buried under hundreds of prior messages.

## When to Start Fresh

If a conversation has drifted, or if you've pivoted direction, sometimes it's better to start a new session and carry over only the relevant context.

**Signs you should start fresh:**
- You're repeating yourself because AI forgot something from 50 messages ago
- The conversation has wandered through multiple unrelated topics
- You need AI to approach a problem with "fresh eyes" rather than anchored to previous suggestions

**How to carry context forward:**
1. Summarize key decisions/learnings from the old conversation
2. Save to a file (or copy into system prompt)
3. Start new conversation with just the distilled context

## The Flip Side: Don't Overload Late

While recency matters, dumping 5000 words of context right before "What should I do?" overwhelms the model. There's a sweet spot: enough recent context to ground the answer, not so much that signal drowns in noise.

**Rule of thumb:** The last 3-5 exchanges should contain the most decision-relevant information. Everything else is background.
