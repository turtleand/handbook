# Always Invite AI to the Table

Don't pre-filter tasks for AI. Don't decide in advance what's "too creative" or "too complex" or "not worth the effort." Invite AI to participate in everything, then choose what to use.

This is [Ethan Mollick's first principle](/foundations/ethan-mollick-principles), and it's the most important habit to build.

## The Mental Shift

Most people ask: "Is this task suitable for AI?"

AI-first practitioners ask: "How can AI contribute to this task?"

The difference is subtle but transformative. The first question leads to binary yes/no thinking. The second opens collaboration.

## What This Looks Like

In our practice, AI participates in:

- **Writing code** — drafts functions, suggests refactors, writes tests
- **Content creation** — outlines articles, drafts sections, suggests titles
- **Research** — summarizes papers, finds relevant sources, compares approaches
- **Project management** — tracks tasks, updates status, suggests priorities
- **Communication** — drafts emails, summarizes threads, prepares meeting notes
- **Problem-solving** — explores alternatives, identifies edge cases, suggests experiments

Some outputs ship as-is. Some need heavy editing. Some get discarded. That's fine. The cost of inviting AI is near zero. The potential upside is unbounded.

## The Surprise Factor

The most valuable AI contributions often come from tasks you didn't think AI could handle.

**Example:** We assumed visual design required human creativity. But AI-generated UI layouts often nail the structure, even if colors need tweaking. We assumed strategic planning was purely human work. But AI brainstorming sessions surface options we wouldn't have considered.

You don't discover these surprises unless you invite AI to try.

## Common Objections

**"It's faster to just do it myself."**  
Maybe, the first time. But if it's a task you'll repeat, the learning investment pays off. And "faster" ignores the fatigue cost — AI doesn't get tired of repetitive work.

**"AI doesn't understand my domain."**  
Not yet. But if you never invite it, it never learns. Feed it context. Correct its mistakes. Like onboarding a junior teammate.

**"I don't want to lose the human touch."**  
You won't. Inviting AI doesn't mean accepting its output blindly. You're still the editor, the decision-maker, the one who ships.

## How to Build This Habit

1. **Start your day with AI:** Before opening your task list, ask AI to help prioritize.
2. **Narrate your work:** Explain what you're doing to AI, even if you don't need help. Sometimes articulating the problem reveals a solution.
3. **Default to voice:** Speaking to AI feels more natural than typing. Use voice input when possible.
4. **Keep AI in the loop:** Don't just use AI for discrete tasks. Let it observe your workflow. Feed it context continuously.

The goal isn't to use AI for everything. The goal is to **consider** AI for everything, then choose consciously.
