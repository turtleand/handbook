# Be a Navigator, Not a Passenger

AI generates fast and sounds confident. That confidence isn't the same as correctness. Your job is to steer, not just ride along.

This means two things. First, [validate what AI gives you](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/validate-ai-responses/). Models hallucinate. They produce plausible-sounding code that doesn't handle edge cases, persuasive arguments built on wrong premises, confident claims with no basis. Treat every output as a draft, not a final answer.

Second, don't just validate. [Expand, filter, absorb](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/expand-filter-absorb/). Ask for alternatives. Challenge assumptions. Request different angles. Then filter down to what's actually useful and absorb it into your own understanding. The value isn't in the first response. It's in what you do with it.

Passengers accept the first answer. Navigators shape the conversation until the output is genuinely good.
