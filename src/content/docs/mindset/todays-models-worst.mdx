title: Today's Models Are the Worst They'll Ever Be

Every model you use today is the worst version you'll ever experience. This means: don't wait for AI to "get good enough." It's already good enough. And it only gets better.

If you build a workflow around today's capabilities, that workflow improves automatically as models advance. The investment is front-loaded. The returns compound forever.

This principle was articulated by [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) in *Co-Intelligence*. It remains one of the most practical frames for AI adoption: start now, because waiting has a compounding cost too.
