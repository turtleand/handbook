title: If AI Becomes the Framework
description: "EXPERIMENTAL: When AI shifts from library to framework, the callbacks humans provide become the critical design decision."

Today, most organizations use AI as a library. Humans call it when they need something: generate this, summarize that, review this code. The human decides when and how to invoke AI.

There's a possibility this inverts. AI becomes the framework, and humans become the callbacks. The AI orchestrates the workflow and calls on humans when it needs judgment, approval, creativity, or domain expertise. Some agentic systems already work this way.

If that shift happens, the critical question changes. It's no longer "how do we call AI effectively?" It's "what functions do we offer for AI to invoke?" What skills, what judgment, what oversight do humans provide at the points where AI calls on them?

Organizations that think about this early can design their human contributions intentionally. What are the callbacks worth preserving? Where does human judgment add the most value? Where is human involvement just ceremony?

This isn't a certainty. It's a possibility worth watching. If the inversion happens, the organizations that thought about their callbacks will adapt faster than those that didn't.
