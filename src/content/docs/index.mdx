# Human-AI Collaboration Handbook

These are the principles every organization should consider as AI becomes infrastructure.

Not theory. Not hype. Just what we've learned building real systems with AI as a core collaborator.

## What This Is

A quick-reference guide organized by theme. Each principle is short, opinionated, and grounded in practice. Think of it as design patterns for human-AI collaboration.

You can read cover-to-cover or jump to what you need right now. Each page stands alone.

## Categories

- **Mindset**. How to think about AI as it evolves
- **Workflow**. Practical patterns for getting work done
- **Economics**. Managing tokens, models, and compute budgets
- **Quality**. Keeping standards high when AI does the first draft
- **Organizational Knowledge**. Building institutional memory with AI
- **Human Element**. Where humans stay in charge (and why)

## Philosophy

AI is a tool that gets better every day. The workflows you build now will only improve as models advance. The cost of learning is front-loaded. The benefits compound forever.

Start anywhere that resonates. Apply immediately. Adjust based on what works for your team.
