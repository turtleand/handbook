title: Seek a Plurality of Voices
description: Use multiple perspectives from both AI and humans to broaden understanding and sharpen judgment.

A single perspective is a single blind spot. This applies to [humans and AI equally](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/plurality-of-voices-ai/).

Ask multiple models. Ask the same model to argue different sides. But don't stop at AI. Your organization has another type of collaborator: other people. A domain expert catches what models miss. Someone outside the domain asks the question nobody thought to ask. A junior team member sees the assumption everyone else takes for granted.

The more angles you see, the better your judgment becomes. And better judgment is the one thing neither AI nor any single colleague can replace on their own.
