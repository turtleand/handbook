# Be a Navigator, Not a Passenger

AI generates fast and sounds confident. That confidence isn't the same as correctness. Your job is to steer, not just ride along.

This means two things. First, [validate what AI gives you](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/validate-ai-responses/). Models hallucinate. They produce plausible-sounding code that doesn't handle edge cases, persuasive arguments built on wrong premises, confident claims with no basis. Treat every output as a draft, not a final answer.

Second, don't just validate. [Expand, filter, absorb](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/expand-filter-absorb/). Ask for alternatives. Challenge assumptions. Request different angles. Then filter down to what's actually useful and absorb it into your own understanding. The value isn't in the first response. It's in what you do with it.

## Seek a Plurality of Voices

A single perspective is a single blind spot. This applies to [humans and AI equally](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/plurality-of-voices-ai/).

Ask multiple models. Ask the same model to argue different sides. But don't stop at AI. Your organization has another type of collaborator: other people. A domain expert catches what models miss. Someone outside the domain asks the question nobody thought to ask. A junior team member sees the assumption everyone else takes for granted.

The more angles you see, the better your judgment becomes. And better judgment is the one thing neither AI nor any single colleague can replace on their own.
