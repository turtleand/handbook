title: Compound Your Context
description: The more your AI knows about you, the more valuable every interaction becomes. Context compounds like interest.

The first time you ask AI to write something, you get generic output. The tenth time, after you've documented your writing style, your banned words, your audience, your philosophy, it gives you something that sounds like you.

That's compounding context. Every preference, decision, constraint, and lesson you record makes every future interaction more valuable. Present-you pays a small cost writing it down. Future-you gets a collaborator that understands your goals without re-explanation.

With zero context, every task requires full explanation. With rich context, you say "write a post about X" and get something usable. The task time shrinks. The output quality increases. That's the return on documentation.
