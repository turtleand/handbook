title: "Share Learnings, Never Expose Ourselves"
description: "Document your process publicly. Never confirm your specific vulnerabilities."

Building in public is valuable. Documenting how you work compounds knowledge. But there's a line between sharing lessons and exposing attack vectors.

## What to Share

Patterns, principles, frameworks. The lessons you learned. The workflows you developed. The decisions you made and why.

Talk about:
- How you structure AI collaboration
- Which review processes caught bugs
- What automation you built and why
- Mistakes you made and how you fixed them

These are useful to others. They help people learn. They establish expertise.

## What Not to Share

Specific gaps in your defenses. Which exact checks you don't have. What precise vulnerabilities exist in your infrastructure.

Don't confirm:
- "We don't validate X in production"
- "Our deployment pipeline skips Y"
- "We haven't implemented Z security check yet"

Even if it's true. Especially if it's true.

## The Difference

**Good:** "We learned that sub-agents can generate code that compiles but has rendering bugs, so we built a visual review checkpoint."

**Bad:** "We don't have automated visual regression testing, so broken UI can reach production."

Same lesson. One describes your solution. One describes your gap.

## The Attacker's Advantage

If you publicly confirm you're vulnerable to X, anyone can try X. You've done their reconnaissance for them.

Document what you do right. Fix what you do wrong quietly.

## Balancing Transparency

This doesn't mean hiding everything. It means being strategic about what you confirm.

Share your principles. Share your patterns. Share your learnings.

But when you talk about what you're missing or what doesn't work yet — phrase it as a solved problem, not an open gap.

"We used to have this gap, here's how we fixed it" beats "We currently have this gap" every time.

## In Practice

Before publishing anything about your infrastructure, ask:
- Does this teach people something useful?
- Does this confirm a specific vulnerability we have?
- Could an attacker use this information?

If it teaches without exposing, ship it. If it exposes without teaching, keep it internal.

Share liberally. Confirm strategically.
