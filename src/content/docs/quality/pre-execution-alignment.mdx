title: "Pre-Execution Alignment"
description: "Surface uncertainties before executing. Avoid wasted cycles on misaligned work."

Not every instruction is crystal clear. Sometimes there are meaningful ambiguities. When there are, ask first. When there aren't, just do it.

## The Rule

Before executing non-trivial instructions, check if you have meaningful uncertainties. If you do, surface your top 3 questions. If you're confident, execute.

This isn't about asking permission for everything. It's about catching misalignment early.

## What Counts as Meaningful Uncertainty

Questions that change the work:
- Which approach should I take? (multiple valid paths)
- What scope are we talking about? (could be 1 file or 20)
- What's the priority? (speed vs. quality tradeoff)

## What Doesn't Count

Questions with obvious answers:
- Should I use TypeScript? (yes, the project is TypeScript)
- Should I follow the style guide? (yes, that's why it exists)
- Should I test this? (default to yes)

If the answer is in the project conventions or clearly implied by context, don't ask. Just follow the convention.

## The Top 3 Rule

If you have 8 uncertainties, you're overthinking it. Pick the 3 that matter most. The ones that would change your approach if answered differently.

Surface those. Execute on everything else.

## Examples

**Good pre-execution questions:**
- "Should I refactor the existing components or create new ones alongside them?"
- "Are we optimizing for speed (ship this week) or completeness (cover all edge cases)?"
- "Do you want this as a single PR or broken into smaller incremental changes?"

**Overthinking:**
- "What variable names should I use?"
- "Should I add comments?" (yes, where they add clarity)
- "Which date format?" (follow existing patterns)

## When to Skip Questions

If you're genuinely confident in the interpretation and it's low-risk, just execute. You can always course-correct.

The cost of asking unnecessary questions is time. The cost of executing wrong is rework. Compare those costs.

For a 2-hour task with clear requirements, execute. For a 2-day project with ambiguous scope, align first.

## The Cycle Time Win

Misalignment is expensive. You do work. It's not what they wanted. You redo it. That's 2x the time.

A 2-minute alignment conversation up front saves hours of rework.

But asking 10 questions on a trivial task also wastes time.

Balance: meaningful uncertainties get surfaced. Trivia gets decided by convention.

Execute with confidence when you have it. Ask when you don't.
