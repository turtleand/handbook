# The 14.3% Daily Budget

**The math:** 7 days in a week. 100% ÷ 7 = 14.3% per day.

If you spend more than 14.3% of your weekly token budget on any given day, you're on track to run out before the week ends.

## Why This Matters

AI API quotas reset weekly (or monthly, depending on your plan). If you burn through 50% of your tokens on Monday, you're running in degraded mode for the rest of the week.

**The goal:** Sustainable daily usage. Enough capacity to do valuable work every day, not feast-or-famine.

## The Tracking System

You need to know:
1. **Weekly quota:** How many tokens you have available
2. **Current burn rate:** How many tokens you've used so far
3. **Days remaining:** How much time is left in the cycle
4. **Projected usage:** Will you hit zero before the reset?

**Our tool:** `turtleand usage` command shows:
- Total usage this week
- Percentage consumed
- Recommended daily spend
- Panic mode indicator (if over-budget)

## The Color Zones

### Green Zone (0-15% daily)

**Status:** On track. Sustainable usage.

**Action:** Continue normal work. No restrictions.

### Yellow Zone (15-25% daily)

**Status:** Above target, but not critical.

**Action:**
- Favor Sonnet over Opus
- Batch tasks more aggressively
- Defer non-urgent work

### Red Zone (25%+ daily)

**Status:** Unsustainable. Will run out before week end.

**Action:**
- Pause non-critical AI work
- Use Haiku by default
- Manual work for high-token tasks
- Review what caused the spike

### Panic Mode (Quota nearly exhausted, days remaining)

**Status:** Emergency.

**Action:**
- Only critical tasks use AI
- Everything else is manual
- Plan better for next cycle

## Real-World Application

**Week Example:**

| Day | Usage | Cumulative | Status |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| Mon | 12% | 12% | ✅ Green |
| Tue | 15% | 27% | ✅ Green |
| Wed | 20% | 47% | ⚠️ Yellow |
| Thu | 10% | 57% | ✅ Green |
| Fri | 14% | 71% | ✅ Green |
| Sat | 15% | 86% | ✅ Green |
| Sun | 14% | 100% | ✅ On target |

**Analysis:** Wednesday spike was fine because we compensated Thursday. Overall usage sustainable.

**Bad Example:**

| Day | Usage | Cumulative | Status |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| Mon | 30% | 30% | 🔴 Red |
| Tue | 25% | 55% | 🔴 Red |
| Wed | 20% | 75% | 🚨 Panic |
| Thu | 15% | 90% | 🚨 Panic |
| Fri | 10% | 100% | 🚨 Empty |
| Sat | 0% | 100% | ❌ No quota |
| Sun | 0% | 100% | ❌ No quota |

**Analysis:** Burned too hot early in week. Had to stop work Friday-Sunday.

## Causes of Budget Overruns

**Common culprits:**

1. **Opus overuse:** Every Opus call is ~5x Sonnet. Easy to blow budget.
2. **Inefficient prompts:** Sending too much context per request.
3. **Unnecessary calls:** Calling AI for tasks humans could do faster.
4. **No batching:** Making 100 separate API calls instead of 10 batched calls.
5. **Conversation bloat:** Long histories eating tokens every request.

**The fix:** Profile where tokens go. Optimize the biggest consumers.

## The Buffer Strategy

Instead of targeting exactly 14.3% per day, target **12-13%.**

**Why:**
- Gives you buffer for unexpected spikes
- Allows occasional heavy days without panic
- Accommodates weekend work (if quota is weekly)

**Math:** 13% × 7 = 91%. You have 9% buffer for emergencies.

## Weekly Reset Awareness

Know when your quota resets:

- **Weekly plans:** Often reset Sunday night or Monday morning
- **Monthly plans:** First of the month

**Plan accordingly:**
- Heavy work early in cycle? You have room to recover
- Heavy work late in cycle? Risk running out

**Our habit:** Check usage Monday morning. Adjust week's plan based on quota available.

## The Trade-Off

**Aggressive usage:**
- Pro: Get more work done early
- Con: Might run out, forced into manual mode

**Conservative usage:**
- Pro: Consistent capacity all week
- Con: Leave quota unused if underestimate needs

**Our approach:** Slightly conservative (12-13% daily target). Better to leave a bit unused than run out.

## When to Violate the Rule

**Valid reasons to exceed 14.3% in a day:**

1. **Launch day:** Publishing 10 articles, need AI help
2. **Emergency fix:** Production issue, need AI for rapid debugging
3. **Research sprint:** Deep dive on new topic, will be quiet rest of week
4. **Buffer available:** You've been under-budget all week, have quota to spare

**Invalid reasons:**

1. "I didn't know we had a budget" (you do now)
2. "I wanted to get this done fast" (burning quota isn't faster, it's shorter-sighted)
3. "I thought it would be fine" (check the numbers)

## The Long-Term Benefit

When you manage token budgets well:
- AI assistance is always available when you need it
- No mid-week panic
- Predictable productivity
- Trust that the tool will be there

**It's not about rationing.** It's about sustainable, consistent use.
