title: Agents Scan, Humans Verify
description: Agents regularly scan for potential errors and risks. Humans review what they find.

Don't wait for problems to surface. Agents can continuously scan your work for potential errors, risks, inconsistencies, and regressions. They flag what looks wrong. Humans decide what's actually wrong.

This is the same principle as the automated first pass, applied to quality assurance. Agents do the tedious, repetitive scanning that humans skip because it's boring. Broken links, outdated references, security risks, visual regressions, content inconsistencies. Agents catch the things humans forget to check.

The human role shifts from "find problems" to "verify and prioritize the problems agents found." That's a much better use of human attention.
