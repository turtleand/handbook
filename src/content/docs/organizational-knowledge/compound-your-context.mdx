title: "Compound Your Context"

Context compounds over time like interest.

## The Compounding Effect

Every preference you document, every decision you record, every lesson you capture — these make future interactions more valuable.

The first time you ask your AI to write a blog post, it gives you generic content.

The tenth time, after you've documented:
- Your writing style (no em dashes, use contractions)
- Your banned words (delve, leverage, landscape)
- Your content philosophy (practical, opinionated, from experience)
- Your target audience (builders, not executives)

...it gives you content that sounds like you.

That's compounding context.

## What Compounds

**Preferences:** "I prefer X over Y because Z" — once documented, never needs re-explaining

**Constraints:** "We can't do X because Y" — saves asking the same question repeatedly

**Decisions:** "We chose this approach because..." — prevents revisiting settled questions

**Lessons:** "This didn't work because..." — prevents repeating mistakes

**Patterns:** "When doing X, we always Y" — establishes conventions

## The Investment

Every time you document something instead of just saying it, you're investing in future efficiency.

Present-you pays a small cost (writing it down). Future-you gets a big return (not having to explain it again).

And "future-you" might be tomorrow. Or next week. Or next month.

## Where It Lives

Context lives in files:
- `MEMORY.md` for personal context
- `AGENTS.md` for how things work
- `TOOLS.md` for environment specifics
- Project `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific rules

The more complete these files become, the more your AI can operate independently without asking basic questions.

## The Multiplier

With zero context, every task requires full explanation.

With rich context, you can say "write a blog post about X" and get something usable, because the AI already knows:
- How you write
- What you care about
- What to avoid
- What quality means to you

The task time shrinks. The output quality increases. That's compounding.

## Long-Term Thinking

This is a multi-month, multi-year investment.

After one week, context helps a little.
After one month, context helps a lot.
After one year, context is transformative.

Your AI goes from a tool that needs constant guidance to a collaborator that understands your goals.

## The Discipline

It's tempting to skip documentation. "I'll just tell it this time."

But that's spending instead of investing. You get one-time value instead of compounding value.

Train yourself to document instead of explain. Every time you find yourself re-explaining something, that's a signal it should be written down.

Build your context deliberately. The returns are exponential.
