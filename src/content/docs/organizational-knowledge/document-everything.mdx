If it's not written down, it doesn't exist.

## The Problem with Memory

AI sessions restart. Context resets. Every conversation starts from scratch unless you explicitly load prior state.

Making a "mental note" means it's gone the next time you wake up.

This applies to:
- Decisions made and why
- Lessons learned from mistakes
- Context about projects
- Preferences and constraints
- Things to remember for later

If it matters, write it down. If you're not sure if it matters, write it down anyway. Storage is cheap. Forgetting is expensive.

## Where to Document

Different types of information live in different places:

**Daily logs:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw notes of what happened today

**Long-term memory:** `MEMORY.md` — curated wisdom, the important stuff

**Project context:** `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SKILLS.md` — how things work

**Decisions:** Wherever relevant (project READMEs, CLAUDE.md files, etc.)

The where matters less than the that. Just write it somewhere you'll find it again.

## What to Capture

More than you think.

Not just big decisions. Also small ones. "We tried X, it didn't work, we're doing Y instead" is worth recording.

Not just facts. Also reasoning. "We chose X because of constraint Y" tells future-you why, so they don't reverse the decision without understanding it.

Not just successes. Especially failures. "This approach seemed good but broke because Z" prevents repeating mistakes.

## The Discipline

It feels like overhead at first. Writing things down takes time.

But forgetting and rediscovering takes more time.

You make a decision once. You might need to reference it ten times. The documentation pays for itself.

## Text > Brain

Your brain forgets. Session restarts erase context. Files persist.

When someone says "remember this for next time," that's a trigger. Open a file. Write it down.

When you learn a hard lesson, document it before you move on.

When you make a decision, capture the reasoning.

Future-you will thank present-you. And present-you won't have to re-explain the same thing five times.

## Recovery from Amnesia

The worst time to wish you'd documented something is when you need it and it's not there.

Second-worst is when someone asks "why did we do it this way?" and you have no answer because it's lost in a conversation from three months ago.

Documentation is insurance. You pay a small cost up front to avoid a big cost later.

Write it down.
