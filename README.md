# Human-AI Collaboration Handbook

Practical principles for working with AI. Not theory. Not hype. Just what we've learned building real systems.

**Live at:** [handbook.turtleand.com](https://handbook.turtleand.com)

## What This Is

A quick-reference guide for teams and individuals navigating the AI era. Each principle is short, opinionated, and grounded in real experience building AI-assisted workflows.

This isn't a course or a tutorial. It's a handbook. You look up what you need, apply it, move on.
