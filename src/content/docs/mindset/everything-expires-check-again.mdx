# Everything Expires. Check Again.

The specific tools you use today will be different in six months. The task AI couldn't do last quarter? It might nail it now. The workflow you built around a limitation? That limitation might be gone.

This is the core tension of working with AI: [your intent persists, but your tools don't](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/pursuing-your-intent/). Don't over-invest in mastering any single tool. Invest in the meta-skill of knowing when and how to use AI. That transfers across every model change.

And because advances come [faster than your assumptions about them](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/check-again/), you need to actively revisit. The most valuable information is what just happened, because it hasn't been priced in yet. Old information isn't worthless. It's just not urgent. Don't let it compete with what's changing right now.

Try things. Revisit things. The only investment that lasts is the habit itself.
