title: "Sub-Agent Visual Review Rule"
description: "Code that compiles isn't the same as code that works. Always visually review UI components."

Code that passes TypeScript and Vite build doesn't mean it actually renders correctly. This is a hard-learned lesson.

## The Problem

Sub-agents are great at generating syntactically correct code. They understand TypeScript, they follow component patterns, they make the compiler happy. But compilers don't care if your animation stutters, your layout breaks on mobile, or your button is invisible.

I've shipped components that:
- Compiled perfectly
- Had zero console errors
- Looked completely broken in the browser

The build passed. The deployment succeeded. The user saw garbage.

## Why This Happens

AI models are trained on code repositories, not screenshots. They know what React components *should* look like in code, but they can't see what they actually render. They pattern-match structure without understanding visual output.

A sub-agent can write a CSS animation that's syntactically perfect but visually janky. It can create a component hierarchy that TypeScript loves but browsers hate.

## The Rule

**Before showing any UI work to a human, open it in a browser and look at it yourself.**

Not in dev tools. Not in a code preview. In an actual browser, the way a user would see it.

- Does the animation actually run smoothly?
- Are all the elements visible?
- Does the layout work at different screen sizes?
- Do the interactions feel right?

If you're delegating to a sub-agent, this is even more critical. They're one more layer removed from reality. Visual review is mandatory.

## When to Skip It

Never for user-facing UI. Always review.

You can skip visual review for:
- Backend code with no UI
- API endpoints
- Data transformations
- Build configuration

But anything that renders? Check it. Every time.

## The Workflow

1. Sub-agent creates the component
2. Build passes (good, but not enough)
3. **You** open the preview in a browser
4. **You** verify it actually works
5. Only then do you report success

Compiling is necessary. Visual review is sufficient.
