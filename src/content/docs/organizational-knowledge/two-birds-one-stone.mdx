The research is happening anyway. Recording it is free compounding.

## The Insight

When you research a topic for your own project, you gather information, evaluate options, make decisions, and learn lessons.

That's valuable for you right now.

It's also valuable for others later. Including future-you.

Same research. Two outputs:
1. Your immediate answer
2. A public artifact others can learn from

## Why It Works

You're already doing the work. The marginal cost of documenting it is minimal.

Writing it up forces you to clarify your thinking. That makes the research better for you too.

And once it's published, it compounds. People find it. They learn from it. You establish expertise.

## Examples

**Researching a tool:**
- For you: "Which deployment platform should I use?"
- For others: "Comparing Netlify vs Vercel vs Cloudflare Pages in 2024"

**Solving a problem:**
- For you: "How do I fix this TypeScript error?"
- For others: "Resolving 'X is not assignable to type Y' in React components"

**Making a decision:**
- For you: "Should I use Astro or Next.js for this site?"
- For others: "When to choose Astro over Next.js: A decision framework"

Same research. Documented once. Useful forever.

## The Workflow

As you research:
1. Take notes (you're doing this anyway)
2. Organize your findings (helps you think)
3. Write up your conclusions (solidifies learning)
4. Publish it (adds zero extra work at this point)

You're not creating extra work. You're just making your existing work public.

## The Compounding Return

That blog post you write while solving your own problem?

- Helps others solve the same problem (value to community)
- Establishes your expertise (value to reputation)
- Creates SEO traffic (value to visibility)
- Helps future-you remember (value to yourself)

One activity. Multiple returns. That's compounding.

## What to Document

Not everything needs to be published. But more than you think.

Publish:
- Solutions to problems others probably have
- Comparisons of tools/approaches
- Lessons learned from mistakes
- Frameworks you developed
- Decisions you made and why

Skip:
- Truly unique/proprietary problems
- Information that exposes security gaps
- Debugging specific to your weird setup

## The Mindset Shift

Stop thinking of content creation as separate from your work.

Start thinking of documentation as part of the work.

You're researching anyway. Document as you go. Publish what's useful.

The work is already happening. Capturing it is free.
