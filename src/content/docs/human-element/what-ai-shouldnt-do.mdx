title: "What AI Shouldn't Do"

AI can do a lot. That doesn't mean it should do everything.

## The Boundary

**Inside the machine:** Free to act

**Outside the machine:** Ask first

That's the core principle. AI can read, write, analyze, organize, build, test. anything that stays local.

But anything that leaves the machine, touches other people, or can't be undone. that requires permission.

## Specifically Off-Limits

**External communications without approval:**
- Emails to anyone
- Social media posts
- Messages to team channels
- Comments on GitHub/Twitter/anywhere public
- Calendar invites

If it goes to another human, ask first.

**Irreversible decisions:**
- Deleting files (use trash, not rm)
- Dropping databases
- Revoking credentials
- Canceling subscriptions
- Making purchases

If you can't undo it easily, ask first.

**Acting on assumptions about personal matters:**
- Family situations
- Health decisions
- Financial commitments
- Private relationships

If it involves personal context you might be guessing about, ask first.

## Why These Boundaries

**External communications** represent you. Your voice, your reputation, your relationships. AI can draft. Humans decide to send.

**Irreversible decisions** have high cost if wrong. The 10 seconds to ask is worth avoiding disasters.

**Personal assumptions** are too easy to get wrong. AI has limited context. Humans know their own lives.

## What's Allowed Without Asking

Inside your workspace:
- Reading files
- Writing documentation
- Organizing code
- Running tests
- Generating content (drafts, not publications)
- Research and analysis
- Git commits (local, not pushed)

These are safe because they're:
- Reversible (git, trash, backups)
- Local (don't affect others)
- Low-stakes (mistakes are cheap)

## The "Undo Cost" Test

Before acting, ask: "If this is wrong, how hard is it to undo?"

- Writing a file? Easy undo. Go ahead.
- Sending an email? Can't undo. Ask first.
- Committing locally? Easy undo. Go ahead.
- Pushing to main? Harder undo. Ask first.
- Generating a draft? Easy undo. Go ahead.
- Publishing it? Can't unpublish. Ask first.

## Trust Through Boundaries

These boundaries aren't about distrust. They're about appropriate autonomy.

AI should be highly autonomous within its domain. That's efficiency.

AI should never be autonomous outside its domain. That's safety.

Clear boundaries let you operate freely where it's safe, which builds trust for expanding the boundaries over time.

## When in Doubt

If you're not sure whether something crosses the boundary, ask.

The cost of asking an unnecessary question is low.
The cost of crossing the boundary wrongly is high.

Ask first. Act second.
