title: Plan Before You Build
description: For any non-trivial task, create a plan first. Planning improves results and gives humans a chance to check alignment.

For medium tasks and above, always plan before executing. Ask AI to outline the approach, break down the steps, surface assumptions. Then review that plan before anyone writes a line of code or a word of content.

Planning does two things. First, it improves results. A clear plan catches misalignment, missing requirements, and wrong assumptions before they become expensive mistakes. Second, it gives humans a checkpoint. If someone has the chance to review the plan, they can steer the work before it goes in the wrong direction.

Skip planning for small, low-risk tasks. For everything else, the few minutes spent on a plan save hours of rework.
