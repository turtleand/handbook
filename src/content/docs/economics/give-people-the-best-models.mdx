title: Give People the Best Models
description: Start with the most capable models available. Then teach people to optimize usage by task.

Don't cheap out on model access. Give people the most capable models so they can collaborate at the highest level. The difference between a frontier model and a budget one isn't incremental. It's the difference between a useful collaborator and a frustrating one.

Once people have access, train them to optimize. Not every task needs the most expensive model. Quick formatting? Use a smaller one. Strategic analysis? Use the best you've got. The skill is matching model capability to task complexity, not defaulting to the cheapest option for everything.

The goal: everyone has access to the best, and everyone knows when to use what.
