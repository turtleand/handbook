# The Last 5 Minutes Matter Most

AI capabilities change faster than your assumptions about them. What didn't work last month might work today. What works today might be obsolete next quarter.

The most valuable information is what just happened. Not literally five minutes, but the principle: recent developments carry the most signal because they haven't been priced in yet. They represent the bleeding edge of change. And they're what you can still act on.

This means you need to [check again](https://growth.turtleand.com/posts/check-again/). Regularly. The task you dismissed as "AI can't do that" three months ago? Try it again. The workflow you built around a limitation? That limitation might be gone.

Old information isn't worthless. It's just not urgent. Don't let it compete with what's happening right now.
