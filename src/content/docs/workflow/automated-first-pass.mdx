title: Automated First Pass, Human Final Review
description: Let AI draft, human refines. Spend human time where it matters most.

The most productive AI workflow: AI generates the first draft, human provides the final review.

AI is faster at starting from blank, structuring information, generating variations, handling boilerplate. Humans are better at judging quality, adding nuance, aligning with goals, making final calls. Let each side do what it's good at.

When reviewing AI output, focus on accuracy, alignment with the goal, what's missing, and whether it sounds like you or like generic AI. Don't waste time on formatting or boilerplate. That's AI's job.

Sometimes the first draft is 90% there and needs quick edits. Sometimes it's 50% and needs another round with better instructions. If you're spending more time editing than writing from scratch, rethink the prompt.
