title: Living Institutional Memory
description: Organizations should accumulate intelligence over time, not lose it when people leave.
---

Knowledge in organizations degrades by default. People leave, context disappears, teams repeat old mistakes. Documentation exists but nobody reads it at the right moment.

Living institutional memory means AI agents that have access to the full history of decisions, retrospectives, and reasoning. They surface relevant context proactively, before someone repeats a mistake or duplicates work that's already been done.

This isn't a search engine or a wiki. It's a system that understands relationships between information and intervenes at the right time. New employees don't read onboarding docs. They have a conversation with the organization's memory and get exactly the context they need.

**The practice:** Log every decision with its reasoning. Give AI agents access to that history. Let them connect the dots.

The organization that remembers everything learns faster than the one that keeps forgetting.
