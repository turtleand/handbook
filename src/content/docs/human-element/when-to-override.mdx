title: "When to Override"
description: "AI recommendations are inputs, not decisions. Override when expertise, stakes, or context say otherwise."

AI gives recommendations. Humans make decisions.

Sometimes the AI is right. Sometimes it's confidently wrong. Knowing when to override is critical.

## When to Override

**Domain expertise says otherwise:**

AI pattern-matches from training data. You have specific knowledge of your domain.

If AI suggests an approach that sounds generically good but conflicts with what you know about your users, your market, or your constraints — trust your expertise.

Example: AI recommends a complex feature. You know your users want simplicity. Override.

**Stakes are high:**

The higher the stakes, the more you should question recommendations.

Low stakes (styling a button): AI's suggestion is probably fine.

High stakes (architecture decisions, security choices, user data handling): Don't just accept AI output. Verify. Challenge. Override if needed.

**The AI is clearly pattern-matching wrong context:**

AI sometimes applies patterns from the wrong domain.

It might suggest enterprise-scale solutions for a hobby project. Or startup tactics for an established company. Or solutions that worked for different tech stacks.

If the recommendation smells like "best practices from somewhere else," override.

## When NOT to Override

**It's just unfamiliar:**

New to you doesn't mean wrong. AI might know patterns you haven't seen yet.

If the recommendation is unfamiliar but well-reasoned, consider it. Research it. Don't reject it just because it's new.

**You're bikeshedding:**

If you're overriding because you prefer blue to green, or camelCase to snake_case, or any other stylistic preference without real impact — let it go.

Save overrides for decisions that matter.

**It's ego:**

"I wouldn't have done it that way" isn't a reason to override.

"This approach has problems X and Y" is a reason.

Check your motivation. If it's "I'm smarter than the AI," that's ego. If it's "this doesn't work because Z," that's judgment.

## How to Override Effectively

Don't just reject. Explain.

**Bad:** "No, do it differently."

**Good:** "This approach won't work because X. Instead, try Y because Z."

AI can learn from your reasoning. Future recommendations get better.

## The Collaboration Model

Think of AI as a very fast junior engineer who's read everything but lacks your specific context.

Junior engineers give good suggestions most of the time. Sometimes they miss important context. When they do, you course-correct with explanation.

That's not undermining them. That's collaboration.

## Trust But Verify

Default to trusting AI recommendations. They're usually good.

But verify on important decisions. And override when verification fails.

The goal isn't to always agree. It's to get the best outcome.

Sometimes that means accepting AI's suggestion. Sometimes it means overriding with your expertise.

Both are valid. Choose based on the situation, not the source.
