title: "Zero Breaking Changes Policy"
description: "Auto-revert if smoke tests fail. Ship with confidence, rollback without hesitation."

Breaking production is unacceptable. Not "unfortunate." Not "happens sometimes." Unacceptable.

## The Policy

If a merge causes post-deploy smoke tests to fail, auto-revert immediately. No discussion, no debugging in production, no "quick fix." Rollback first, fix later.

This isn't about blame. It's about reliability.

## What Qualifies as Breaking

- Site doesn't build
- Critical pages return 404
- Console errors on load
- Core functionality broken (navigation, forms, etc.)

It doesn't matter if the code "should" work. If it breaks production, it reverts.

## Auto-Merge Windows

Structure and config changes can auto-merge after a 4-hour human review window. If no objection within that window, the merge happens automatically.

**But.** If post-merge smoke tests fail, the auto-merge was wrong. Revert, fix the tests or the code, try again.

The 4-hour window is for catching conceptual problems. The smoke tests are for catching execution problems.

## Content Never Auto-Merges

Blog posts, documentation, topic guides — these always need human review before merging. Not because AI can't write. Because content represents your voice, your philosophy, your brand.

Structure can auto-merge. Content can't.

## Trust Through Safety

Auto-merge is earned through zero breaking changes. Every clean deploy increases trust. Every broken deploy resets the counter.

If you want more automation, ship more reliability. The path to less oversight is through perfect execution.

## The Rollback Mindset

Reverting isn't failure. Reverting is discipline.

You tried something. It didn't work. You undo it and try again. That's engineering.

Leaving production broken while you debug "just one more thing" — that's failure.

## Implementation

1. Merge happens (auto or manual)
2. Deploy triggers
3. Smoke tests run on production
4. If any test fails: auto-revert to previous commit
5. Alert human with failure details
6. Fix in a new branch, repeat

The goal isn't to never make mistakes. The goal is to never *ship* mistakes.
